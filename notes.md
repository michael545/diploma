## Notes

### Plot Adjustments
- Modify the plots to include blank spaces for periods when stocks don't trade.
- Ensure no linear interpolation is applied during these gaps.

### Analysis Script
- Create a script to compare the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for 15-minute, 5-minute, and 1-hour intervals.
- Use appropriate statistical methods to analyze and visualize the results.

### Conclusion
- Discuss why the model effectively learns trends but struggles with capturing volatility.
- Highlight potential reasons such as data limitations, model architecture, or feature engineering.
- Suggest improvements or alternative approaches to address volatility learning.

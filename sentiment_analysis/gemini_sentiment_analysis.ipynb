      "The headline explicitly states \"INTC surges 3%,\" which is a clear indicator of a positive market reaction. While \"record layoffs\" might typically be seen as negative news, the stock's surge suggests the market interprets these drastic measures as a necessary step towards cost-cutting, efficiency improvements, and long-term profitability. For a company like Intel that has faced significant financial and operational challenges (including past manufacturing delays), layoffs are often viewed by investors as a decisive move to streamline operations and improve financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, \"confirms new process deadlines\" signals a commitment to addressing past manufacturing issues and provides a clear roadmap for future product development and production. This certainty and proactive approach are also positive signals for investors looking for a turnaround. Therefore, despite the harsh reality of layoffs, the market views these actions as crucial and positive steps for Intel's future performance and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relevant News from the Web to Support Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick search for \"Intel layoffs\" and \"Intel process roadmap\" reveals consistent themes over the past year or two:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Cost-Cutting and Restructuring:** Intel has been undergoing a significant restructuring under CEO Pat Gelsinger. Announcements of layoffs and cost reductions (often in the billions of dollars) have been widely reported as part of a strategy to improve profitability and become more agile. Analysts and investors have largely seen these moves as essential for Intel's long-term viability, even if painful. For example, in October 2022, Intel announced plans for \"significant cost reductions\" including layoffs, and this was generally interpreted as a necessary step in their turnaround efforts.\n",
      "2.  **Manufacturing Turnaround (IDM 2.0 Strategy):** Intel has been heavily focused on regaining its manufacturing leadership, an initiative dubbed \"IDM 2.0.\" This involves aggressive goals to deliver \"five nodes in four years\" (referring to manufacturing process technology). The confirmation of \"new process deadlines\" aligns with this strategy, indicating progress and commitment to hitting their technology roadmap. Investors generally welcome clear deadlines and progress in manufacturing, as past delays have severely impacted Intel's competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** The market's positive reaction (stock surge) to layoffs and confirmed process deadlines is consistent with the broader narrative around Intel's turnaround strategy, where aggressive cost-cutting and a focused push on manufacturing are seen as crucial for the company's future success.\n"

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Acquisition**: You'll need to find a way to get news headlines for your specific ticker and time period. This could involve:\n",
    "    *   Using news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, EOD Historical Data - many require subscriptions).\n",
    "    *   Web scraping (be mindful of website terms of service).\n",
    "    *   Using pre-existing datasets if available.\n",
    "2.  **Data Loading**: Once you have the data, load it into this notebook (e.g., using pandas).\n",
    "3.  **Iterate and Analyze**: Loop through your headlines, send each one to the Gemini API using a similar prompt structure, and store the results.\n",
    "4.  **Refine Prompt**: Adjust the prompt to get the sentiment in the format you need (e.g., just \"Positive\", \"Negative\", \"Neutral\", or a numerical score, or with confidence levels).\n",
    "5.  **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for API calls.\n",
    "6.  **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits if you are processing a large number of headlines."

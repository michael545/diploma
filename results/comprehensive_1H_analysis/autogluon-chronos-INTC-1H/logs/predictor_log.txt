train_data with frequency 'IRREG' has been resampled to frequency 'h'.
Provided train_data has 13869 rows (NaN fraction=55.0%), 1 time series. Median time series length is 13869 (min=13869, max=13869). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
